## 📊 Project Overview

An interactive Streamlit-based business intelligence dashboard designed to analyze last-mile delivery performance data. This dashboard enables logistics managers to **identify delays, optimize fleet usage, and improve operational efficiency** through data-driven insights.

**Key Objective:** Transform raw delivery data into actionable insights by visualizing the impact of weather, traffic, vehicle types, agent performance, geographic areas, and product categories on delivery times and delay rates.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎯 Compulsory Visualizations (5)

1. **Delay Analyzer**  
   - Dual bar charts showing average delivery time by weather and traffic conditions
   - Overlaid line graphs displaying late delivery percentages
   - Helps managers identify environmental factors causing delays

2. **Vehicle Performance Comparison**  
   - Color-coded bar chart comparing average delivery times across vehicle types
   - Enables fleet optimization decisions based on speed and reliability

3. **Agent Performance Insights**  
   - Interactive scatter plot: Agent Rating vs. Delivery Time
   - Color-coded by age groups (<25, 25-40, 40+)
   - Includes trendline to identify performance patterns
   - Supports targeted training and staffing decisions

4. **Geographic Performance Heatmap**  
   - Area × Category heatmap showing average delivery times
   - Reveals cross-dimensional bottlenecks
   - Prioritizes operational interventions in high-delay zones

5. **Category Distribution Analysis**  
   - Box plot showing delivery time distribution by product category
   - Identifies categories with consistent delays
   - Informs SLA adjustments and handling protocols

### 🎛️ Interactive Filters

- **Weather Condition** (multi-select)
- **Traffic Level** (multi-select)
- **Vehicle Type** (multi-select)
- **Delivery Area** (multi-select)
- **Product Category** (multi-select)

All visualizations and KPIs update **instantly** when filters are applied.

### 📈 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Average Delivery Time** (minutes)
- **Late Delivery Rate** (percentage)
- **Total Deliveries** (filtered count)
- **Average Agent Rating** (1-5 scale)

KPIs display delta values compared to overall dataset for quick insights.

### 🎁 Bonus Features

- **📤 CSV Export:** Download filtered summaries aggregated by Traffic, Weather, Vehicle, Area, and Category
- **📊 Optional Visualizations:** Delivery time distribution histogram, late delivery analysis, deliveries by area
- **ℹ️ Data Quality Report:** View cleaning steps, summary statistics, and value counts
- **🎨 Professional UI:** Custom CSS styling with readable metrics and consistent color schemes

## 📊 Data Processing Pipeline

### 1. Data Loading
- Reads Excel file using `openpyxl` engine
- Flexible column name detection (handles variations)

### 2. Data Cleaning
- **Missing values:** Drop rows missing critical delivery time, fill numeric fields with median, categorical with mode
- **Data types:** Convert delivery time, agent age, and rating to numeric
- **Standardization:** Title case for categories, strip whitespace
- **Validation:** Check for required columns, log cleaning operations

### 3. Feature Engineering
- **Late Delivery Flag:** Binary indicator where `delivery_time > (mean + 1 × std deviation)`
- **Age Groups:** Bin agent ages into <25, 25-40, 40+ categories
- **Time Categories:** Classify deliveries as Very Fast, Fast, Average, Slow

### 4. Aggregation
- Group by Traffic, Weather, Vehicle, Area, Category
- Calculate mean delivery time and late delivery percentage
- Count observations per group

### 5. Filtering & Visualization
- Apply user-selected sidebar filters
- Dynamically update all charts and KPIs
- Export aggregated summaries to CSV

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'openpyxl'`  
**Solution:** Run `pip install openpyxl` or ensure `requirements.txt` is installed

**Issue:** Dashboard loads slowly  
**Solution:** Data is cached on first load. Subsequent loads are instant.

**Issue:** Charts not updating with filters  
**Solution:** Ensure all filter multi-selects have at least one option selected

**Issue:** "Missing required columns" error  
**Solution:** Verify Excel file has columns: Delivery_Time, Traffic, Weather, Vehicle, Agent_Age, Agent_Rating, Area, Category
